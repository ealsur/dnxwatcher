# DNX version watcher
## Visual Studio Code Extension 
-------------------
This extension allows you to keep your OmniSharp server environment up-to-date with your current **global.json** settings.

The extension will restart OmniSharp when it detects changes on your specified SDK version so your Intellisense and commands refresh their support.
